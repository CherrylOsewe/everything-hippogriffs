    <h3> Hippogriffs in history.</h3>
    <p>According to Vidal, a Spanish historian, this creature was supposed to live near Céret, in the County of
      Roussillon of
      modern-day France, during the Middle Ages. Claw marks were found on a rock near Mas Carol. The belief in the
      existence of the hippogriff, such as Ariosto describes, is fiercely attacked in a scientific essay on religion in
      1862,
      which argues that such an animal can neither be a divine creation, nor truly exist. The Book of Enoch quite
      clearly
      details how Satan and his fallen angels created various hybrids by admixture. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx"> Sphinx</a>
      <!-- add link here-->is the most well known such
      hybrid. The hippogriff is supposed to be a mixture of several animals and the author notes that in order to
      support its weight, the wings would be so heavy that flight would be impossible, which proves—without question—that it does not exist.

    <h3>
      Etymology
    </h3>
    <p>The word hippogriff, also spelled hippogryph, is derived from the Ancient Greek: ἵππος híppos, meaning
      "horse", and the Italian grifo meaning "griffin" (from Latin gryp or gryphus), which denotes another mythical creature, with
      the head of an eagle and body of a lion, that is purported to be the father of the hippogriff. The word hippogriff
      was adopted into English shortly before 1615.</p>

    <h3>Symbolism </h3>
    <p>
      In some traditions, the hippogriff is said to be the symbol of love, as its parents, the mare and griffin, are
      natural
      enemies. In other traditions, the hippogriff represents Christ's dual nature as both human and divine.
